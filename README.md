## Synopsis

A refactoring of the ray tracing code found [here](https://github.com/hunterloftis/playfuljs-demos/tree/gh-pages/raycaster). Refactored to use a module pattern. Additions will be added such as jumping, crouching, looking up and down.

## Motivation

Project to get feet wet in JavaScript, and walk away with a ray-tracing engine.

## Demo

You can demo the project [here](http://marvinkassabian.github.io/).
